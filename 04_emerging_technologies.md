# Internet of Things (IoT)

## Purpose
The main purpose of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to connect everyday objects such as devices, sensors, and machines to the internet, allowing them to collect, share, and act on data automatically. This enables automation, real-time monitoring, and data-driven decision-making, improving efficiency and convenience in both education and IT sectors.

## Usage
- **In Education**  
  IoT is transforming classrooms into **smart learning spaces** where devices and tools are interconnected. Teachers can use digital boards, sensors, and connected devices to deliver interactive lessons, track attendance automatically, and monitor the classroom environment (e.g., temperature, lighting) for better comfort. It also enables **remote access to laboratories**, where students can control IoT-enabled equipment from anywhere, and supports **health monitoring** for student safety through wearables. This automation reduces repetitive manual work for teachers and cuts costs by replacing paper-based materials with digital resources.

- **In IT / Industry**  
  IoT is widely used in industries to create **smart operations**. Connected machines and sensors can share real-time data, allowing companies to track assets, optimize supply chains, and monitor equipment health. **Predictive maintenance** helps detect possible equipment failures before they happen, reducing downtime and repair costs. In warehouses, IoT-powered robots and tracking systems can organize, move, and store goods efficiently, improving speed and accuracy while lowering operational costs.

## Examples
- **In Education**:  
  In Education, the **Promethean ActivPanel** is an interactive display that connects to the internet and other devices to deliver engaging lessons. It has helped schools reduce printing costs and increase student participation. It’s not just a digital whiteboard but rather an internet-connected interactive display that integrates with cloud platforms, educational apps, and connected devices. Teachers can share content instantly, access online resources, and connect student devices to this panel.

- **In IT**:  
  In IT, the **Amazon** uses IoT-powered robots and sensors in warehouses to move, track, and pack products faster, improving delivery efficiency. These robots are physical devices in warehouses equipped with sensors and internet connectivity. They track inventory, monitor conditions, and communicate in real time with central systems to optimize operations.
